Desirable properties of the chosen topics include document coverage, specificity, topic diversity, and topic homogeneity, each of which, we show, is naturally modeled by a submodular function. Other information, provided say by unsupervised approaches such as LDA and its variants, can also be utilized by defining a submodular function that expresses coherence between the chosen topics and this information.

To address this, we post the task of speech transcription to a large community of online workers (crowd). We also get spoken English grades from the crowd. We achieve 95% transcription accuracy by combining transcriptions from multiple crowd workers. Speech and prosody features are derived by force aligning the speech samples on these highly accurate transcriptions. Additionally, we derive surface and semantic level features directly from the transcription. To demonstrate the efficacy of our approach we performed experiments on an expert\u2013graded speech sample of 319 adult non\u2013native speakers. Using these features in a regression model, we are able achieve a Pearson correlation of 0.76 with expert grades, an accuracy much higher than any previously reported machine learning approach.

The modern view of teaching means students work actively in class, talk with peers, and are coached more than graded by their instructors. In this new world of education, there is a great need for NLP research to step in and help. I hope in this paper to excite colleagues about the possibilities and suggest a few new ways of looking at them.

We use this model to look at the relationship between Tea Party Republicans and \u201cestablishment\u201d Republicans in the U.S. House of Representatives during the 112th Congress. 1 Capturing Political Polarization Ideal-point models are one of the most widely used tools in contemporary political science research (Poole and Rosenthal, 2007). These models estimate political preferences for legislators, known as their ideal points, from binary data such as legislative votes. Popular formulations analyze legislators\u2019 votes and place them on a one-dimensional scale, most often interpreted as an ideological spectrum from liberal to conservative. Moving beyond a single dimension is attractive, however, since people may lean differently based on policy issues; for example, the conservative movement in the U.S. includes fiscal conservatives who are relatively liberal on social issues, and vice versa. In multi-dimensional ideal point models, therefore, the ideal point of each legislator is no longer characterized by a single number, but by a multi-dimensional vector. With that move comes a new challenge, though: the additional dimensions are often difficult to interpret. To mitigate this problem, recent research has introduced methods that estimate multi-dimensional ideal points using both voting data and the texts of the bills being voted on, e.g., using topic models and associating each dimension of the ideal point space with a topic. The words most strongly associated with the topic can sometimes provide a readable description of its corresponding dimension. In this paper, we develop this idea further by introducing HIPTM, the Hierarchical Ideal Point Topic Model, to estimate multi-dimensional ideal points for legislators in the U.S. Congress. HIPTM differs from previous models in three ways. First, HIPTM uses not only votes and associated bill text, but also the language of the legislators themselves; this allows predictions of ideal points from politicians\u2019 writing alone. Second, HIPTM improves the interpretability of ideal-point dimensions by incorporating data from the Congressional Bills Project (Adler and Wilkerson, 2015), in which bills are labeled with major topics from the Policy Agendas Project Topic Codebook.1 And third, HIPTM discovers a hierarchy of topics, allowing us to analyze both agenda issues and issue-specific frames that legislators use on the congressional floor, following Nguyen et al. (2013) in modeling framing as second-level agenda setting (McCombs, 2005). Using this new model, we focus on Republican legislators during the 112th U.S. Congress, from January 2011 until January 2013. This is a particularly interesting session of Congress for political scientists, because of the rise of the Tea Party, a decentralized political movement with populist, libertarian, and conservative elements. Although united with \u201cestablishment\u201d Republicans against Democrats in the 2010 midterm elections, leading to massive Democratic defeats, the Tea Party was\u2014and still is\u2014wrestling with establishment Republicans for control of the Republican party. The Tea Party is a new and complex phenomenon for political scientists; as Carmines and D\u2019Amico (2015) observe: \u201cConventional views of ideology as a single-dimensional, left-right spectrum experience great difficulty in understanding or explaining the Tea Party.\u201d Our model identifies legislators who have low (or high) levels of \u201cTea Partiness\u201d but are (or are not) members of the Tea Party Caucus, and providing insights into the nahttp://www.policyagendas.org/", "venue": "Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics", "year": 2015, "referenceCount": 41, "citationCount": 61, "influentialCitationCount": 3, "isOpenAccess": true, "openAccessPdf": null, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "s2FieldsOfStudy": [{"category": "Computer Science", "source": "external"}, {"category": "Political Science", "source": "s2-fos-model"}], "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle", "Conference"], "publicationDate": "2015-07-01", "journal": {"pages": "1438-1448"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "38345955", "name": "Viet-An Nguyen"}, {"authorId": "1389036863", "name": "Jordan L.

The key idea is to bundle two sets of POS tags together (e.g. \u201c[NN, n]\u201d), and build a conditional random field (CRF) based tagging model in the enlarged space of bundled tags with the help of ambiguous labelings. To train our model on two non-overlapping datasets that each has only one-side tags, we transform a one-side tag into a set of bundled tags by considering all possible mappings at the missing side and derive an objective function based on ambiguous labelings. The key advantage of our coupled model is to provide us with the flexibility of 1) incorporating joint features on the bundled tags to implicitly learn the loose mapping between heterogeneous annotations, and 2) exploring separate features on one-side tags to overcome the data sparseness problem of using only bundled tags. Experiments on benchmark datasets show that our coupled model significantly outperforms the state-ofthe-art baselines on both one-side POS tagging and annotation conversion tasks.

Experimental results show that the two semantic features can accurately predict helpfulness scores and greatly improve the performance compared with using features previously used.

Experimental results show that our method achieves a 0.9 point BLEU gain over the baseline, and a significant reduction in rule table size for both phrase-based and hierarchical phrase-based systems.", "venue": "Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics", "year": 2015, "referenceCount": 33, "citationCount": 9, "influentialCitationCount": 0, "isOpenAccess": true, "openAccessPdf": {"url": "https://doi.org/10.3115/v1/p15-2022", "status": "BRONZE"}, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "s2FieldsOfStudy": [{"category": "Computer Science", "source": "external"}, {"category": "Computer Science", "source": "s2-fos-model"}], "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle", "Conference"], "publicationDate": "2015-07-01", "journal": {"pages": "132-138"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "28825117", "name": "Heng Yu"}, {"authorId": "144809121", "name": "Xuan Zhu"}]}, {"paperId": "2f61a40f79217a62e2714b8c4efc628412f124ac", "externalIds": {"MAG": "2250307129", "ACL": "P15-2023", "DBLP": "conf/acl/HoshinoMSHN15", "DOI": "10.3115/v1/P15-2023", "CorpusId": 15724949}, "corpusId": 15724949, "publicationVenue": {"id": "1e33b3be-b2ab-46e9-96e8-d4eb4bad6e44", "name": "Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics", "type": "conference", "alternate_names": ["Annu Meet Assoc Comput Linguistics", "Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics", "ACL", "Meet Assoc Comput Linguistics"], "url": "https://www.aclweb.org/anthology/venues/acl/"}, "url": "https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/2f61a40f79217a62e2714b8c4efc628412f124ac", "title": "Discriminative Preordering Meets Kendall\u2019s \\tau Maximization", "abstract": "This paper explores a simple discriminative preordering model for statistical machine translation.

Then the challenges of query subtopic mining are how to measure the similarity between queries and group them semantically. This paper proposes an approach for mining subtopics from query log, which jointly learns a similarity measure and groups queries by explicitly modeling the structure among them. Compared with previous approaches using manually defined similarity measures, our approach produces more desirable query subtopics by learning a similarity measure.

Both proposals provide low-entropy lexical cooccurrence information, and are empirically shown to improve embedding learning by performing notably better than several popular embedding models in similarity tasks. 1 Lexical Embeddings and Relatedness Lexical embeddings are essentially real-valued distributed representations of words. As a vectorspace model, an embedding model approximates semantic relatedness with the Euclidean distance between embeddings, the result of which helps better estimate the real lexical distribution in various NLP tasks. In recent years, researchers have developed efficient and effective algorithms for learning embeddings (Mikolov et al., 2013a; Pennington et al., 2014) and extended model applications from language modelling to various areas in NLP including lexical semantics (Mikolov et al., 2013b) and parsing (Bansal et al., 2014). To approximate semantic relatedness with geometric distance, objective functions are usually chosen to correlate positively with the Euclidean similarity between the embeddings of related words. Maximizing such an objective function is then equivalent to adjusting the embeddings so that those of the related words will be geometrically closer. The definition of relatedness among words can have a profound influence on the quality of the resulting embedding models. In most existing studies, relatedness is defined by co-occurrence within a window frame sliding over texts. Although supported by the distributional hypothesis (Harris, 1954), this definition suffers from two major limitations. Firstly, the window frame size is usually rather small (for efficiency and sparsity considerations), which increases the false negative rate by missing long-distance dependencies. Secondly, a window frame can (and often does) span across different constituents in a sentence, resulting in an increased false positive rate by associating unrelated words. The problem is worsened as the size of the window increases since each false-positive n-gram will appear in two subsuming false-positive (n+1)-grams. Several existing studies have addressed these limitations of window-based contexts. Nonetheless, we hypothesize that lexical embedding learning can further benefit from (1) factorizing syntactic relations into individual relations for structured syntactic information and (2) defining relatedness using lexicographic knowledge. We will show that implementation of these ideas brings notable improvement in lexical similarity tasks.", "venue": "Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics", "year": 2015, "referenceCount": 27, "citationCount": 19, "influentialCitationCount": 0, "isOpenAccess": true, "openAccessPdf": null, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "s2FieldsOfStudy": [{"category": "Computer Science", "source": "external"}, {"category": "Computer Science", "source": "s2-fos-model"}], "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle", "Conference"], "publicationDate": "2015-07-01", "journal": {"pages": "458-463"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "2116678322", "name": "Tong Wang"}, {"authorId": "40360972", "name": "Abdel-rahman Mohamed"}, {"authorId": "145036961", "name": "Graeme Hirst"}]}, {"paperId": "e09beb33880425e5439fe076da4be7a6916df460", "externalIds": {"ACL": "P15-2076", "MAG": "2951746425", "DBLP": "conf/acl/FaruquiD15", "ArXiv": "1506.05230", "DOI": "10.3115/v1/P15-2076", "CorpusId": 9199643}, "corpusId": 9199643, "publicationVenue": {"id": "1e33b3be-b2ab-46e9-96e8-d4eb4bad6e44", "name": "Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics", "type": "conference", "alternate_names": ["Annu Meet Assoc Comput Linguistics", "Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics", "ACL", "Meet Assoc Comput Linguistics"], "url": "https://www.aclweb.org/anthology/venues/acl/"}, "url": "https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/e09beb33880425e5439fe076da4be7a6916df460", "title": "Non-distributional Word Vector Representations", "abstract": "Data-driven representation learning for words is a technique of central importance in NLP.

A detailed analysis on over three hundred user-produced texts containing NTAs reveals that highquality NTAs mostly agree with gold segmentation and, consequently, can be used for improving the performance of supervised word segmentation model in out-of-domain. Experiments show that a classification model combined with a voting mechanism can reliably identify the high-quality NTAs texts that are more readily available labeled corpus. Furthermore, the NTAs might be particularly useful to deal with out-of-vocabulary (OOV) words such as proper names and neo-logisms.", "venue": "Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics", "year": 2015, "referenceCount": 20, "citationCount": 2, "influentialCitationCount": 1, "isOpenAccess": true, "openAccessPdf": null, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "s2FieldsOfStudy": [{"category": "Computer Science", "source": "external"}, {"category": "Computer Science", "source": "s2-fos-model"}], "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle", "Conference"], "publicationDate": "2015-07-01", "journal": {"pages": "662-667"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "47845099", "name": "Dakui Zhang"}, {"authorId": "2029345998", "name": "Yushang Mao"}, {"authorId": "2152798274", "name": "Yang Liu"}, {"authorId": "2113289382", "name": "Han Wang"}, {"authorId": "2098742", "name": "Chuyuan Wei"}, {"authorId": "2118811545", "name": "Shiping Tang"}]}, {"paperId": "0f1f802d775b3298d2d74ed32097210b77a83233", "externalIds": {"MAG": "2251285539", "ACL": "P15-2110", "DBLP": "conf/acl/GeJCS15", "DOI": "10.3115/v1/P15-2110", "CorpusId": 16725697}, "corpusId": 16725697, "publicationVenue": {"id": "1e33b3be-b2ab-46e9-96e8-d4eb4bad6e44", "name": "Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics", "type": "conference", "alternate_names": ["Annu Meet Assoc Comput Linguistics", "Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics", "ACL", "Meet Assoc Comput Linguistics"], "url": "https://www.aclweb.org/anthology/venues/acl/"}, "url": "https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/0f1f802d775b3298d2d74ed32097210b77a83233", "title": "One Tense per Scene: Predicting Tense in Chinese Conversations", "abstract": "We study the problem of predicting tense in Chinese conversations.

This procedure leads to improvements in belief tracking performance regardless of the amount of in-domain data available for training the model.", "venue": "Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics", "year": 2015, "referenceCount": 23, "citationCount": 178, "influentialCitationCount": 7, "isOpenAccess": true, "openAccessPdf": {"url": "https://doi.org/10.3115/v1/p15-2130", "status": "BRONZE"}, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "s2FieldsOfStudy": [{"category": "Computer Science", "source": "external"}, {"category": "Computer Science", "source": "s2-fos-model"}], "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle", "Conference"], "publicationDate": "2015-06-23", "journal": {"pages": "794-799"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "3334541", "name": "N.

Firstly, sentences are clustered not only based on the internal information such as words and sentence structures, but also based on the external information such as context in dialogue via Recurrent Neural Networks. Additionally, the DM problem is modeled as a Partially Observable Markov Decision Processes (POMDP) with sentence clusters.

The general research directions of these two fields also have followed different philosophies and principles. For example, NLP aims at deep understanding of individual words, phrases and sentences (\u201cmicro-level\u201d), whereas DM aims to conduct a high-level understanding, discovery and synthesis of the most salient information from a large set of documents when working on text data (\u201cmacro-level\u201d). But they share the same goal of distilling knowledge from data. In the past five years, these two areas have had intensive interactions and thus mutually enhanced each other through many successful text mining tasks. This positive progress mainly benefits from some innovative intermediate representations such as \u201cheterogeneous information networks\u201d [Han et al., 2010, Sun et al., 2012b]. However, successful collaborations between any two fields require substantial mutual understanding, patience and passion among researchers. Similar to the applications of machine learning techniques in NLP, there is usually a gap of at least several years between the creation of a new DM approach and its first successful application in NLP. More importantly, many DM approaches such as gSpan [Yan and Han, 2002] and RankClus [Sun et al., 2009a] have demonstrated their power on structured data. But they remain relatively unknown in the NLP community, even though there are many obvious potential applications. On the other hand, compared to DM, the NLP community has paid more attention to developing large-scale data annotations, resources, shared tasks which cover a wide range of multiple genres and multiple domains. NLP can also provide the basic building blocks for many DM tasks such as text cube construction [Tao et al., 2014]. Therefore in many scenarios, for the same approach the NLP experiment setting is often much closer to real-world applications than its DM counterpart. We would like to share the experiences and lessons from our extensive inter-disciplinary collaborations in the past five years. The primary goal of this tutorial is to bridge the knowledge gap between these two fields and speed up the transition process. We will introduce two types of DM methods: (1). those state-of-the-art DM methods that have already been proven effective for NLP; and (2). some newly developed DM methods that we believe will fit into some specific NLP problems. In addition, we aim to suggest some new research directions in order to better marry these two areas and lead to more fruitful outcomes. The tutorial will thus be useful for researchers from both communities. We will try to provide a concise roadmap of recent perspectives and results, as well as point to the related DM software and resources, and NLP data sets that are available to both research communities.", "venue": "Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics", "year": 2015, "referenceCount": 65, "citationCount": 4, "influentialCitationCount": 0, "isOpenAccess": true, "openAccessPdf": {"url": "https://www.aclweb.org/anthology/P15-5001.pdf", "status": "HYBRID"}, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "s2FieldsOfStudy": [{"category": "Computer Science", "source": "external"}, {"category": "Computer Science", "source": "s2-fos-model"}], "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle", "Conference", "Review"], "publicationDate": "2015-07-01", "journal": {"pages": "1-4"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "145325584", "name": "Jiawei Han"}, {"authorId": "144016781", "name": "Heng Ji"}, {"authorId": "2109461904", "name": "Yizhou Sun"}]}, {"paperId": "7376ff8856c79385b6f48c57da0f21b256540db8", "externalIds": {"DBLP": "conf/acl/GormleyE14", "ACL": "P15-5002", "MAG": "2250971366", "DOI": "10.3115/v1/P15-5002", "CorpusId": 41528213}, "corpusId": 41528213, "publicationVenue": {"id": "1e33b3be-b2ab-46e9-96e8-d4eb4bad6e44", "name": "Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics", "type": "conference", "alternate_names": ["Annu Meet Assoc Comput Linguistics", "Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics", "ACL", "Meet Assoc Comput Linguistics"], "url": "https://www.aclweb.org/anthology/venues/acl/"}, "url": "https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/7376ff8856c79385b6f48c57da0f21b256540db8", "title": "Structured Belief Propagation for NLP", "abstract": "Statistical natural language processing relies on probabilistic models of linguistic structure. More complex models can help capture our intuitions about language, by adding linguistically meaningful interactions and latent variables. However, inference and learning in the models we want often poses a serious computational challenge. Belief propagation (BP) and its variants provide an attractive approximate solution, especially using recent training methods. These approaches can handle joint models of interacting components, are computationally efficient, and have extended the state-of-the-art on a number of common NLP tasks, including dependency parsing, modeling of morphological paradigms, CCG parsing, phrase extraction, semantic role labeling, and information extraction (Smith and Eisner, 2008; Dreyer and Eisner, 2009; Auli and Lopez, 2011; Burkett and Klein, 2012; Naradowsky et al., 2012; Stoyanov and Eisner, 2012). This tutorial delves into BP with an emphasis on recent advances that enable state-of-the-art performance in a variety of tasks. Our goal is to elucidate how these approaches can easily be applied to new problems. We also cover the theory underlying them. Our target audience is researchers in human language technologies; we do not assume familiarity with BP. In the first three sections, we discuss applications of BP to NLP problems, the basics of modeling with factor graphs and message passing, and the theoretical underpinnings of \u201cwhat BP is doing\u201d and how it relates to other inference techniques. In the second three sections, we cover key extensions to the standard BP algorithm to enable modeling of linguistic structure, efficient inference, and approximation-aware training.

For example, the first twenty publications on Google Scholar returned for the Query \u201csentiment analysis\u201d all date from 2003 or later, and have a total citation count of 12,140. The total number of publications is in the thousands. Partly, this interest is driven by the immediate commercial applications of sentiment analysis. Sentiment is a \u201cprivate state\u201d (Wiebe, 1990). However, it is not the only private state that has received attention in the computational literature; others include belief and intention. In this tutorial, we propose to provide a deeper understanding of what a private state is. We will concentrate on sentiment and belief. We will provide background that will allow the tutorial participants to understand the notion of a private state as a cognitive phenomenon, which can be manifested linguistically in communication in various ways. We will explain the formalization in terms of a triple of state, source, and target. We will discuss how to model the source and the target. We will then explain in some detail the annotations that have been made. The issue of annotation is crucial for private states: while the MPQA corpus (Wiebe et al., 2005; Wilson, 2007) has been around for some time, most research using it does not make use of many of its features. We believe this is because the MPQA annotation is quite complex and requires a deeper understanding of the phenomenon of \u201cprivate state\u201d, which is what the annotation is getting at. Furthermore, there are currently several efforts underway of creating new versions of annotations, which we will also present. The larger goal of this tutorial is to allow the tutorial participants to gain a deeper understanding of the role of private states in human communication, and to encourage them to use this deeper understanding in their computational work. The immediate goal of this tutorial is to allow the participants to make more complete use of available annotated resources. We propose to achieve these goals by concentrating on annotated corpora, since this will allow participants to both understand the underlying content (achieving the larger goal) and the technical details of the annotations (achieving the immediate goal).", "venue": "Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics", "year": 2015, "referenceCount": 33, "citationCount": 4, "influentialCitationCount": 0, "isOpenAccess": true, "openAccessPdf": {"url": "https://www.aclweb.org/anthology/P15-5003.pdf", "status": "HYBRID"}, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "s2FieldsOfStudy": [{"category": "Computer Science", "source": "external"}, {"category": "Computer Science", "source": "s2-fos-model"}], "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle", "Conference", "Review"], "publicationDate": "2015-07-01", "journal": {"pages": "7-11"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "1702447", "name": "Owen Rambow"}, {"authorId": "144120827", "name": "J.

Positive/negative reviews directly translate to financial gains/losses for companies. This unfortunately gives strong incentives for opinion spamming which refers to illegal human activities (e.g., writing fake reviews and giving false ratings) that try to mislead customers by promoting/demoting certain entities (e.g., products and businesses). The problem has been widely reported in the news. Despite the recent research efforts on detection, the problem is far from solved. What is worse is that opinion spamming is widespread. While credit card fraud is as rare as 0.2%, based on our research we estimated that up to 30% of the reviews on many Web sites could be fake. Thus, detecting fake reviews and opinions is a pressing and also profound issue as it is critical to ensure the trustworthiness of the information on the web. Without detecting them, the social media could become a place full of lies, fakes, and deceptions, and completely useless. Major review hosting sites and e-commerce vendors have already made some progress in detecting fake reviews. However, the task is still extremely challenging because it is very difficult to obtain large-scale ground truth samples of deceptive opinions for algorithm development and for evaluation, or to conduct large-scale domain expert evaluations. Further, in contrast to other kinds of spamming (e.g., Web and link spam, social/blog spam, email spam, etc.) opinion spam has a very unique flavor as it involves fluid sentiments of users and their evaluations. Thus, they require a very different treatment. Since our first paper in 2007 (Jindal and Liu, 2007) on the topic, our group and many other researchers have proposed several algorithms and bridged algorithmic methodologies from various scientific disciplines including computational linguistics (Ott et al., 2011), social and behavioral sciences (Jindal and Liu, 2008; Mukherjee et al., 2013a, b), machine learning, data mining and Bayesian statistics (Mukherjee et al., 2012; Fei et al., 2013; Mukherjee et al., 2013c; Li et al., 2014b; Li et al., 2014a) to solve the problem. The field of deceptive opinion spam has gained a lot of interest in communications (Hancock et al., 2008), psycholinguistics communities (Gokhman et al., 2012), and economic analysis (Wang, 2010) apart from mainstream NLP and Web mining as attested by publications in top tier venues in their respective communities. The problem has far reaching implications in various allied NLP topics including Lie Detection, Forensic Linguistics, Opinion Trust and Veracity Verification and Plagiarism Detection. However, owing to the inherent nature of the problem, a unique blend of NLP, data mining, machine learning, social, behavioral, and statistical techniques are required which many NLP researchers may not be familiar with. In this tutorial, we aim to cover the problem in its full depth and width, covering diverse algorithms that have been developed over the past 7 years. The most attractive quality of these techniques is that many of them can be adapted for cross-domain and unsupervised settings. Some of the methods are even in use by startups and established companies. Our focus is on insight and understanding, using illustrations and intuitive deductions. The goal of the tutorial is to make the inner workings of these techniques transparent, intuitive and their results interpretable.", "venue": "Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics", "year": 2015, "referenceCount": 40, "citationCount": 13, "influentialCitationCount": 1, "isOpenAccess": true, "openAccessPdf": {"url": "https://www.aclweb.org/anthology/P15-5007.pdf", "status": "HYBRID"}, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "s2FieldsOfStudy": [{"category": "Computer Science", "source": "external"}, {"category": "Computer Science", "source": "s2-fos-model"}], "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle", "Conference", "Review"], "publicationDate": "2015-07-01", "journal": {"pages": "21-22"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "40014030", "name": "Arjun Mukherjee"}]}, {"paperId": "d3924eddda7f7d80216f8d8d63d19b41bfcd5132", "externalIds": {"DBLP": "conf/acl/Huang15", "MAG": "2250403465", "ACL": "P15-5008", "DOI": "10.3115/v1/P15-5008", "CorpusId": 33871285}, "corpusId": 33871285, "publicationVenue": {"id": "1e33b3be-b2ab-46e9-96e8-d4eb4bad6e44", "name": "Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics", "type": "conference", "alternate_names": ["Annu Meet Assoc Comput Linguistics", "Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics", "ACL", "Meet Assoc Comput Linguistics"], "url": "https://www.aclweb.org/anthology/venues/acl/"}, "url": "https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/d3924eddda7f7d80216f8d8d63d19b41bfcd5132", "title": "What You Need to Know about Chinese for Chinese Language Processing", "abstract": "The synergy between language sciences and language technology has been an elusive one for the computational linguistics community, especially when dealing with a language other than English.

As the biggest Chinese search engine, Baidu has released its machine translation system in June, 2011. It now supports translations among 27 languages on multiple platforms, including PC, mobile devices, etc. Hybrid translation approach is important for building an Internet translation system. As we know, the translation demands on the Internet come from various domains, including news wires, patents, poems, idioms, etc. It is difficult for a single translation system to achieve high accuracy on all domains. Therefore, hybrid translation is practically needed. Generally, we build a statistical machine translation (SMT) system, using the training corpora automatically crawled from the web. For the translation of idioms (e.g. \u201c\u6709 \u5fd7\u8005,\u4e8b\u7adf\u6210,where there is a will, there is a way\u201d), hot words/expressions (e.g. \u201c\u4e00\u5e26\u4e00\u8def, One Belt and One Road \u201d), example-based translation methods are used. To improve the translation of date (e.g. \u201c2012\u5e747\u67086\u65e5, July 6, 2012\u201d), numbers (e.g. \u201c\u4e09\u5343\u4e94\u767e\u4e07, thirty-five million), etc, rule-based methods are used as pre-process. To improve translation quality for the resourcepoor language pairs, we used pivot-based methods. Wu and Wang (2007) proposed the triangulation method that combines the source-pivot and the pivot-target phrase tables to induce a sourcetarget phrase table. To fill up the data gap between the source-pivot and pivot-target corpora, Wu and Wang (2009) employed a hybrid method combining RBMT and SMT systems. We also proposed a method to use a Markov random walk to discover implicit relations between phrases in the source and target languages (Zhu et al., 2013), thus to improve the coverage of phrase pairs. We utilized the co-occurrence frequency of source-target phrase pairs to estimate phrase translation probabilities (Zhu et al., 2014). On May 20th this year, we have launched a neural machine translation (NMT) system for Chinese-English translation. The system conducts end-to-end translation with a source language encoder and a target language decoder. Both the encoder and decoder are recurrent neural networks. The strength of NMT lies in that it can learn semantic and structural translation information by taking global contexts into account. We further integrated the SMT and NMT system to improve translation quality. We also released off-line translation packs for NMT system on mobile devices, providing translation services in case that the Internet is unavailable. So far as we know, this is the first NMT system supporting off-line translation on mobile devices. We also investigate the problem of learning a machine translation model that can simultaneously translate sentences from one source language to multiple target languages (Dong et al., 2015). Our solution is inspired by the recently proposed neural machine translation model which generalizes machine translation as a sequence learning problem. We train a unified neural machine translation model under the multi-task learning framework where the encoder is shared across different language pairs and each target language has a separate decoder. This model gets faster and better convergence for both resource-rich and resourcepoor language pairs under the multi-task learning framework. Based on the above techniques, we have released translation products for multiple platforms, including web translation on PC, APP on mobile devices, as well as free API for the thirdparty developers.

To control for these confounding factors, we take advantage of the surprising fact that there are many pairs of tweets containing the same url and written by the same user but employing different wording. Given such pairs, we ask: which version attracts more retweets? This turns out to be a more difficult task than predicting popular topics.

For example, instead of creating separate grammar symbols to mark the definiteness of an NP, our parser might instead capture the same information from the first word of the NP. Moving context out of the grammar and onto surface features can greatly simplify the structural component of the parser: because so many deep syntactic cues have surface reflexes, our system can still parse accurately with context-free backbones as minimal as Xbar grammars. Keeping the structural backbone simple and moving features to the surface also allows easy adaptation to new languages and even to new tasks. On the SPMRL 2013 multilingual constituency parsing shared task (Seddah et al., 2013), our system outperforms the top single parser system of Bjorkelund et al. (2013) on a range of languages. In addition, despite being designed for syntactic analysis, our system also achieves stateof-the-art numbers on the structural sentiment task of Socher et al. (2013).

Lexical semantic clue verifies whether a candidate term is related to the target product, and contextual semantic clue serves as a soft pattern miner to find candidates, which exploits semantics of each word in context so as to alleviate the data sparsity problem. We build a semantic similarity graph to encode lexical semantic clue, and employ a convolutional neural model to capture contextual semantic clue.

It involves three main subtasks: (i) selecting the relevant portion of input data; (ii) determining the words that will be used to verbalise the selected data; and (iii) mapping these words into natural language text. The latter task is known as Surface Realisation (SR). In my thesis, I study the SR task in the context of input data coming from Knowledge Bases (KB). I present two novel approaches to surface realisation from knowledge bases: a supervised approach and a weakly supervised approach. \n \nIn the first, supervised, approach, I present a corpus-based method for inducing a Feature Based Lexicalized Tree Adjoining Grammar (FB-LTAG) from a parallel corpus of text and data. The resulting grammar includes a unification based semantics and can be used by an existing surface realiser to generate sentences from test data. I show that the induced grammar is compact and generalises well over the test data yielding results that are close to those produced by a handcrafted symbolic approach and which outperform an alternative statistical approach. \n \nIn the weakly supervised approach, I explore a method for surface realisation from KB data which uses a supplied lexicon but does not require a parallel corpus. Instead, I build a corpus from heterogeneous sources of domain-related text and use it to identify possible lexicalisations of KB symbols (classes and relations) and their verbalisation patterns (frames). Based on the observations made, I build different probabilistic models which are used for selection of appropriate frames and syntax/semantics linking while verbalising KB inputs. I evaluate the output sentences and analyse the issues relevant to learning from non-parallel corpora. \n \nIn both these approaches, I use the data derived from an existing biomedical ontology as a reference input. The proposed methods are generic and can be easily adapted for input from other ontologies for which a parallel/non-parallel corpora exists.", "venue": "Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics", "year": 2014, "referenceCount": 50, "citationCount": 16, "influentialCitationCount": 1, "isOpenAccess": true, "openAccessPdf": {"url": "https://aclanthology.org/P14-1040.pdf", "status": "HYBRID"}, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "s2FieldsOfStudy": [{"category": "Computer Science", "source": "external"}, {"category": "Computer Science", "source": "s2-fos-model"}], "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle", "Conference"], "publicationDate": "2014-06-22", "journal": {"pages": "424-434"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "2942586", "name": "B.

Two agents learn concurrently by interacting with each other without any need for simulated users (SUs) to train against or corpora to learn from. In particular, we compare the Qlearning, Policy Hill-Climbing (PHC) and Win or Learn Fast Policy Hill-Climbing (PHC-WoLF) algorithms, varying the scenario complexity (state space size), the number of training episodes, the learning rate, and the exploration rate. Our results show that generally Q-learning fails to converge whereas PHC and PHC-WoLF always converge and perform similarly. We also show that very high gradually decreasing exploration rates are required for convergence.

However, in most current statistical machine translation (SMT) systems, the outputs of compound-complex sentences still lack proper transitional expressions. As a result, the translations are often hard to read and understand. To address this issue, we propose two novel models to encourage generating such transitional expressions by introducing the source compoundcomplex sentence structure (CSS). Our models include a CSS-based translation model, which generates new CSS-based translation rules, and a generative transfer model, which encourages producing transitional expressions during decoding. The two models are integrated into a hierarchical phrase-based translation system to evaluate their effectiveness. The experimental results show that significant improvements are achieved on various test data meanwhile the translations are more cohesive and smooth.", "venue": "Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics", "year": 2014, "referenceCount": 31, "citationCount": 16, "influentialCitationCount": 2, "isOpenAccess": true, "openAccessPdf": null, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "s2FieldsOfStudy": [{"category": "Computer Science", "source": "external"}, {"category": "Computer Science", "source": "s2-fos-model"}], "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle", "Conference"], "publicationDate": "2014-06-01", "journal": {"pages": "850-860"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "145942217", "name": "Mei Tu"}, {"authorId": "2110631853", "name": "Yu Zhou"}, {"authorId": "2423168", "name": "Chengqing Zong"}]}, {"paperId": "eb3b3ee3cbc08fff52b7f1000179e5be5da44443", "externalIds": {"MAG": "2251553982", "ACL": "P14-1081", "DBLP": "conf/acl/HuangXIR14", "DOI": "10.3115/v1/P14-1081", "CorpusId": 15598604}, "corpusId": 15598604, "publicationVenue": {"id": "1e33b3be-b2ab-46e9-96e8-d4eb4bad6e44", "name": "Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics", "type": "conference", "alternate_names": ["Annu Meet Assoc Comput Linguistics", "Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics", "ACL", "Meet Assoc Comput Linguistics"], "url": "https://www.aclweb.org/anthology/venues/acl/"}, "url": "https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/eb3b3ee3cbc08fff52b7f1000179e5be5da44443", "title": "Adaptive HTER Estimation for Document-Specific MT Post-Editing", "abstract": "We present an adaptive translation quality estimation (QE) method to predict the human-targeted translation error rate (HTER) for a document-specific machine translation model.

We quantitatively study how earnings calls are correlated with the financial risks, with a special focus on the financial crisis of 2009. In particular, we perform a text regression task: given the transcript of an earnings call, we predict the volatility of stock prices from the week after the call is made. We propose the use of copula: a powerful statistical framework that separately models the uniform marginals and their complex multivariate stochastic dependencies, while not requiring any prior assumptions on the distributions of the covariate and the dependent variable. By performing probability integral transform, our approach moves beyond the standard count-based bag-ofwords models in NLP, and improves previous work on text regression by incorporating the correlation among local features in the form of semiparametric Gaussian copula.

We then introduce fast mapping, a challenging and more cognitively plausible variant of the zero-shot task, in which the learner is exposed to new objects and the corresponding words in very limited linguistic contexts. By combining prior linguistic and visual knowledge acquired about words and their objects, as well as exploiting the limited new evidence available, the learner must learn to associate new objects with words.

We address this issue by learning sentimentspecific word embedding (SSWE), which encodes sentiment information in the continuous representation of words. Specifically, we develop three neural networks to effectively incorporate the supervision from sentiment polarity of text (e.g. sentences or tweets) in their loss functions. To obtain large scale training corpora, we learn the sentiment-specific word embedding from massive distant-supervised tweets collected by positive and negative emoticons.

For example, cube pruning will repeatedly query the language model with hypotheses that differ only in source coverage, despite the fact that source coverage is irrelevant to the language model. Our key contribution avoids this behavior by placing hypotheses into equivalence classes, masking the parts of state that matter least to the score. Moreover, we exploit shared words in hypotheses to iteratively refine language model scores rather than handling language model state atomically.

For example, in the online review domain, most reviewers (authors) only write a few reviews, which are not enough to serve as the training data for accurate classification. In this paper, we present a novel three-view Tri-Training method to iteratively identify authors of unlabeled data to augment the training set. The key idea is to first represent each document in three distinct views, and then perform Tri-Training to exploit the large amount of unlabeled documents.

In this paper we propose to address the problem of automatic labelling of latent topics learned from Twitter as a summarisation problem. We introduce a framework which apply summarisation algorithms to generate topic labels. These algorithms are independent of external sources and only rely on the identification of dominant terms in documents related to the latent topic.

Firstly, each part-of-speech tag of the subordinating conjunctions is annotated with the most general category in the hierarchical knowledge. Those categories are human-defined to represent distinct syntactic constraints, and provide an appropriate starting point for splitting. Secondly, based on the data-driven state-split approach, we establish a mapping from each automatic refined subcategory to the one in the hierarchical knowledge.

Despite this, GPs have seen few applications in natural language processing (notwithstanding several recent papers by the authors). We argue that the GP framework offers many benefits over commonly used machine learning frameworks, such as linear models (logistic regression, least squares regression) and support vector machines. Moreover, GPs are extremely flexible and can be incorporated into larger graphical models, forming an important additional tool for probabilistic inference. Notably, GPs are one of the few models which support analytic Bayesian inference, avoiding the many approximation errors that plague approximate inference techniques in common use for Bayesian models (e.g. MCMC, variational Bayes).1 GPs accurately model not just the underlying task, but also the uncertainty in the predictions, such that uncertainty can be propagated through pipelines of probabilistic components. Overall, GPs provide an elegant, flexible and simple means of probabilistic inference and are well overdue for consideration of the NLP community. This tutorial will focus primarily on regression and classification, both fundamental techniques of wide-spread use in the NLP community. Within NLP, linear models are near ubiquitous, because they provide good results for many tasks, support efficient inference (including dynamic programming in structured prediction) and support simple parameter interpretation.

This tutorial will supply NLP researchers with the mathematical and conceptual background to make use of vector-based models of meaning in their own research. We will begin by motivating the need for a transition from symbolic representations to distributed ones. We will briefly cover how collocational (distributional) vectors can be used and manipulated to model word meaning. We will discuss the progress from distributional to distributed representations, and how neural networks allow us to learn word vectors and condition them on metadata such as parallel texts, topic labels, or sentiment labels. Finally, we will present various forms of semantic vector composition, and discuss their relative strengths and weaknesses, and their application to problems such as language modelling, paraphrasing, machine translation and document classification. This tutorial aims to bring researchers up to speed with recent developments in this fastmoving field. It aims to strike a balance between providing a general introduction to vectorbased models of meaning, an analysis of diverging strands of research in the field, and also being a hands-on tutorial to equip NLP researchers with the necessary tools and background knowledge to start working on such models.

Although this advancement produces significant improvements in BLEU scores, crucial meaning errors and lack of cross-sentence connections at discourse level still hurt the quality of SMT-generated translations. More recently, we have witnessed two active movements in SMT research: one towards combining semantics and SMT in attempt to generate not only grammatical but also meaningpreserved translations, and the other towards exploring discourse knowledge for document-level machine translation in order to capture intersentence dependencies. The emergence of semantic SMT are due to the combination of two factors: the necessity of semantic modeling in SMT and the renewed interest of designing models tailored to relevant NLP/SMT applications in the semantics community. The former is represented by recent numerous studies on exploring word sense disambiguation, semantic role labeling, bilingual semantic representations as well as semantic evaluation for SMT. The latter is reflected in CoNLL shared tasks, SemEval and SenEval exercises in recent years. The need of capturing cross-sentence dependencies for document-level SMT triggers the resurgent interest of modeling translation from the perspective of discourse. Discourse phenomena, such as coherent relations, discourse topics, lexical cohesion that are beyond the scope of conventional sentence-level n-grams, have been recently considered and explored in the context of SMT. This tutorial aims at providing a timely and combined introduction of such recent work along these two trends as discourse is inherently connected with semantics. The tutorial has three parts. The first part critically reviews the phraseand syntax-based SMT. The second part is devoted to the lines of research oriented to semantic SMT, including a brief introduction of semantics, lexical and shallow semantics tailored to SMT, semantic representations in SMT, semantically motivated evaluation as well as advanced topics on deep semantic learning for SMT. The third part is dedicated to recent work on SMT with discourse, including a brief review on discourse studies from linguistics and computational viewpoints, discourse research from monolingual to multilingual, discourse-based SMT and a few advanced topics. The tutorial is targeted for researchers in the SMT, semantics and discourse communities. In particular, the expected audience comes from two groups: 1) Researchers and students in the SMT community who want to design cutting-edge models and algorithms for semantic SMT with various semantic knowledge and representations, and who would like to advance SMT from sentence-bysentence translation to document-level translation with discourse information; 2) Researchers and students from the semantics and discourse community who are interested in developing models and methods and adapting them to SMT.", "venue": "Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics", "year": 2014, "referenceCount": 0, "citationCount": 2, "influentialCitationCount": 0, "isOpenAccess": true, "openAccessPdf": {"url": "https://doi.org/10.3115/v1/p14-6007", "status": "BRONZE"}, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "s2FieldsOfStudy": [{"category": "Computer Science", "source": "external"}, {"category": "Computer Science", "source": "s2-fos-model"}], "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle", "Conference", "Review"], "publicationDate": "2014-06-01", "journal": {"pages": "11-12"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "2263868728", "name": "Deyi Xiong"}, {"authorId": "2265392804", "name": "Min Zhang"}]}, {"paperId": "08ef3df9c3989ab207501b3b353b5ed71443d56d", "externalIds": {"DBLP": "conf/acl/ZhangZL14", "ACL": "P14-6008", "MAG": "2251083838", "DOI": "10.3115/v1/P14-6008", "CorpusId": 11005447}, "corpusId": 11005447, "publicationVenue": {"id": "1e33b3be-b2ab-46e9-96e8-d4eb4bad6e44", "name": "Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics", "type": "conference", "alternate_names": ["Annu Meet Assoc Comput Linguistics", "Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics", "ACL", "Meet Assoc Comput Linguistics"], "url": "https://www.aclweb.org/anthology/venues/acl/"}, "url": "https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/08ef3df9c3989ab207501b3b353b5ed71443d56d", "title": "Syntactic Processing Using Global Discriminative Learning and Beam-Search Decoding", "abstract": "This tutorial discusses a framework for incremental left-to-right structured predication, which makes use of global discriminative learning and beam-search decoding.

An Approach for Argumentation Mining in German Discourses", "abstract": "[In this paper we present a new methodological approach for the analysis of public discourses aiming at the semi-automated identification of arguments by combining methods from discourse analysis with methods from Natural Language Processing. Discourses evolve over long periods of time and, consequently, form a broad database. Up to now, the analysis of discourses is hitherto performed primarily by hand, i.e., only small corpora or discourse fragments can be analyzed. Inevitably, this leads to lengthy and expensive annotation. Thus, there is a growing interest to overcome these methodological challenges by the use of computer-based methods and tools for the semi-automated analysis. However, there are only few approaches known that focus on the analysis of discourses and the (semi-)automated identification of arguments therein (e.g. Reed at al., 2008; Liakata et al., 2012; Ashley and Walker, 2013). Particularly, approaches that can be explicitly used for the analysis of German-language discourses exist only in initial stages. Therefore, we suggest a fine-grained semi-automated approach based on multi-level annotation that focuses on linguistic means as indicators of arguments. The aim is to identify regularities, respectively, indicators in the linguistic surface of the discourse (e.g. recurring lexical and typographical characteristics), which indicate the occurrence of certain arguments (e.g. premise). In this paper, we focus on the identification of indicators of argumentconclusion relationship: conclusive connectors or conclusiva, that are typically adverbs such as hence, consequently, therefore, thus, because (Govier, 2013; see example below): Die Campusbahn werde den Individualverkehr verdrangen, weil die Stadt eng bebaut sei. Schon in den 1970er Jahren sei deshalb das Aus fur die Strasenbahn besiegelt worden. [The campus train will displace the individual traffic because the city is densely built. Therefore, the end for the tram was sealed in the 1970s.] As an application example, a small corpus consisting of 21 newspaper articles is analyzed. The corpus belongs to the interdisciplinary project Future Mobility (FuMob), which is funded by the Excellent Initiative of the German federal and state governments. The methodological approach consists of three steps, which are performed iteratively: (1) manual discourselinguistic argumentation analysis, (2) semiautomatic Text Mining (PoS-tagging and linguistic multi-level annotation), and (3) data merge. (1) Discourse-linguistic argumentation analysis: First, the data is manually analyzed. Objectives of the analysis are (i) identifying discourserelevant arguments, (ii) forming argument classes, and (iii) determining the significance of an argument in the discourse (Niehr 2004). To determine the significance of an argument the use by various discourse participants is analyzed and quantified. The argument-use can be categorized as argumentative, positively cited, negatively cited or neutrally cited. In addition, to identify arguments and their use in public discourse, the analysis also aims to detect and characterize discourse participants who use similar arguments.", "venue": "ArgMining@ACL", "year": 2014, "referenceCount": 9, "citationCount": 8, "influentialCitationCount": 0, "isOpenAccess": true, "openAccessPdf": {"url": "https://doi.org/10.3115/v1/w14-2116", "status": "BRONZE"}, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "s2FieldsOfStudy": [{"category": "Computer Science", "source": "external"}, {"category": "Sociology", "source": "s2-fos-model"}], "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle"], "publicationDate": "2014-06-01", "journal": {"pages": "104-105"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "3104979", "name": "B.

This is especially worrisome in the case of online reviews of products and services, where businesses may feel pressure to post deceptive opinion spam---fictitious reviews disguised to look like authentic customer reviews. In recent years, several approaches have been proposed to identify deceptive opinion spam based on linguistic cues in a review's text. In this talk I will summarize a few of these approaches. I will additionally discuss some of the challenges researchers face when studying this problem, including the difficulty of obtaining labeled data, uncertainties surrounding the prevalence of deception, and how linguistic cues to deceptive opinion spam vary with the text's sentiment (e.g., 5-star vs 1and 2star reviews), domain (e.g., hotel vs. restaurant reviews) and the domain expertise of the author (e.g., crowdsourced vs. employee-written deceptive opinion spam).", "venue": "WASSA@ACL", "year": 2014, "referenceCount": 0, "citationCount": 2, "influentialCitationCount": 0, "isOpenAccess": true, "openAccessPdf": {"url": "https://doi.org/10.3115/v1/w14-2606", "status": "BRONZE"}, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "s2FieldsOfStudy": [{"category": "Computer Science", "source": "external"}, {"category": "Business", "source": "s2-fos-model"}], "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle", "Review"], "publicationDate": "2014-06-01", "journal": {"pages": "31"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "40511414", "name": "Myle Ott"}]}, {"paperId": "193847972c80754bb94f2b39ebf5d2e5076f05b6", "externalIds": {"MAG": "2250812182", "DBLP": "conf/wassa/MohammadZM14", "ACL": "W14-2607", "DOI": "10.3115/v1/W14-2607", "CorpusId": 15071198}, "corpusId": 15071198, "publicationVenue": null, "url": "https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/193847972c80754bb94f2b39ebf5d2e5076f05b6", "title": "Semantic Role Labeling of Emotions in Tweets", "abstract": "Past work on emotion processing has focused solely on detecting emotions, and ignored questions such as \u2018who is feeling the emotion (the experiencer)?\u2019 and \u2018towards whom is the emotion directed (the stimulus)?\u2019.

Sociolinguists focus on frequency and patterns in linguistic usage, correlations, strength of factors and significance, which together reveal information about the sex, age, education and occupation of speakers/writers but also their history, culture, place of residence, social relationships and affiliations.

In this talk, I plan to illustrate a model-driven approach to understanding social behavior around user location and different languages in social media. First, in 2010, we performed the first in-depth study of user location field in Twitter user profiles. We found that 34% of users did not provide real location information, frequently incorporating fake locations or sarcastic comments that can fool traditional geographic information tools. We then performed a simple machine learning experiment to determine whether we can identify a users location by only looking at contents of a user\u2019s tweets. We found that a users country and state can in fact be determined easily with decent accuracy, indicating that users implicitly reveal location information, with or without realizing it. Second, despite the widespread adoption of Twitter in different locales, little research has investigated the differences among users of different languages. In prior research, the natural tendency has been to assume that the behaviors of English users generalize to other language users. We studied 62 million tweets collected over a four-week period. We discovered cross-language differences in adoption of features such as URLs, hashtags, mentions, replies, and retweets. We also found interesting patterns of how multi-lingual Twitter users broker information across these language boundaries.

It is also a powerful political tool, as evidenced through experiments and single-issue studies beyond the lab. Yet compared to its significance, we know very little about framing as a generalizable phenomenon. Do framing dynamics, such as the evolution of one frame into another, play out the same way for all issues? Under what conditions does framing influence public opinion and policy? Understanding the general patterns of framing dynamics and effects is thus hugely important. It is also a serious challenge, thanks to the volume of text data, the dynamic nature of language, and variance in applicable frames across issues (e.g., the \u2018innocence\u2019 frame of the death penalty debate is irrelevant for discussing smoking bans). To address this challenge, I describe a collaborative project with Justin Gross, Philip Resnik, and Noah Smith. We advance a unified policy frames codebook, in which issue-specific frames (e.g., innocence) are nested within high-level categories of frames (e.g., fairness) that cross cut issues. Through manual annotation bolstered by supervised learning, we can track the relative use of different frame cues within a given issue over time and in an apples-to-apples way across issues. Preliminary findings suggest our work may help unlock the black box of framing, pointing to generalizable conditions under which we should expect to see different types of framing dynamics and framing effects.", "venue": "LTCSS@ACL", "year": 2014, "referenceCount": 0, "citationCount": 0, "influentialCitationCount": 0, "isOpenAccess": true, "openAccessPdf": {"url": "https://doi.org/10.3115/v1/w14-2519", "status": "BRONZE"}, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Sociology", "Computer Science"], "s2FieldsOfStudy": [{"category": "Sociology", "source": "external"}, {"category": "Computer Science", "source": "external"}, {"category": "Psychology", "source": "s2-fos-model"}], "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle"], "publicationDate": "2014-06-01", "journal": {"pages": "71"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "2641095", "name": "Amber E.

For each class in the hierarchy either manually predefined or automatically clustered, a linear discriminative function is determined in a top-down way using a perceptron algorithm with the lower-level weight vector derived from the upper-level weight vector. As the upper-level class normally has much more positive training examples than the lower-level class, the corresponding linear discriminative function can be determined more reliably. The upper-level discriminative function then can effectively guide the discriminative function learning in the lower-level, which otherwise might suffer from limited training data. Evaluation on the ACE RDC 2003 corpus shows that the hierarchical strategy much improves the performance by 5.6 and 5.1 in F-measure on least- and medium- frequent relations respectively.

This in turn leads to more succinct and manageable rules. Further, the semantics of the derivations can also be systematically reflected in a compositional way by constructing PRED values on the fly. We illustrate how we use sublexical units for handling simple productive derivational morphology and more interesting cases such as causativization, etc., which change verb valency.

Evaluations on the task of Japanese text input show that BLasso is able to produce the best approximation to the lasso solution, and leads to a significant improvement, in terms of character error rate, over boosting and the traditional maximum likelihood estimation.", "venue": "Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics", "year": 2006, "referenceCount": 23, "citationCount": 16, "influentialCitationCount": 0, "isOpenAccess": true, "openAccessPdf": {"url": "http://dl.acm.org/ft_gateway.cfm?id=1220204&type=pdf", "status": "BRONZE"}, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "s2FieldsOfStudy": [{"category": "Computer Science", "source": "external"}, {"category": "Computer Science", "source": "s2-fos-model"}], "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle", "Conference"], "publicationDate": "2006-07-17", "journal": {"name": "", "pages": "225-232", "volume": ""}, "authors": [{"authorId": "1800422", "name": "Jianfeng Gao"}, {"authorId": "2111436972", "name": "Hisami Suzuki"}, {"authorId": "144923779", "name": "Bin Yu"}]}, {"paperId": "1f36b1a99612b418509b71e84fc5117a8f653e57", "externalIds": {"DBLP": "conf/acl/IshiokaK06", "ACL": "P06-1030", "MAG": "2105578875", "DOI": "10.3115/1220175.1220205", "CorpusId": 17667889}, "corpusId": 17667889, "publicationVenue": {"id": "1e33b3be-b2ab-46e9-96e8-d4eb4bad6e44", "name": "Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics", "type": "conference", "alternate_names": ["Annu Meet Assoc Comput Linguistics", "Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics", "ACL", "Meet Assoc Comput Linguistics"], "url": "https://www.aclweb.org/anthology/venues/acl/"}, "url": "https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/1f36b1a99612b418509b71e84fc5117a8f653e57", "title": "Automated Japanese Essay Scoring System based on Articles Written by Experts", "abstract": "We have developed an automated Japanese essay scoring system called Jess.

The output patterns are intended to be useful for finding further pairs with the same relations, to support the construction of lexicons, ontologies, and semantic networks.

This has led to concern that such parsers may be too finely tuned to this corpus at the expense of portability to other genres. Such worries have merit. The standard \"Charniak parser\" checks in at a labeled precision-recall f-measure of 89.7% on the Penn WSJ test set, but only 82.9% on the test set from the Brown treebank corpus.This paper should allay these fears.

Furthermore, use of the self-training techniques described in (McClosky et al., 2006) raise this to 87.8% (an error reduction of 28%) again without any use of labeled Brown data.

Therefore, it is vital to properly order the information in multi-document summarization. We present a bottom-up approach to arrange sentences extracted for multi-document summarization. To capture the association and order of two textual segments (e.g. sentences), we define four criteria: chronology, topical-closeness, precedence, and succession.

We repeatedly concatenate two textual segments into one segment based on the criterion, until we obtain the overall segment with all sentences arranged.

Towards this, we propose an unsupervised technique to generate domain models automatically from call transcriptions. We use a state of the art Automatic Speech Recognition system to transcribe the calls between agents and customers, which still results in high word error rates (40%) and show that even from these noisy transcriptions of calls we can automatically build a domain model.

Experimental results show that the discriminative pruning method leads to a much smaller model compared with the model pruned using the state-of-the-art method. At the same Chinese word segmentation F-measure, the number of bigrams in the model can be reduced by up to 90%. Correlation between language model perplexity and word segmentation performance is also discussed.", "venue": "Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics", "year": 2006, "referenceCount": 17, "citationCount": 6, "influentialCitationCount": 0, "isOpenAccess": true, "openAccessPdf": null, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "s2FieldsOfStudy": [{"category": "Computer Science", "source": "external"}, {"category": "Computer Science", "source": "s2-fos-model"}], "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle", "Conference"], "publicationDate": "2006-07-17", "journal": {"name": "", "pages": "1001-1008", "volume": ""}, "authors": [{"authorId": "2146361314", "name": "Jianfeng Li"}, {"authorId": "144270731", "name": "Haifeng Wang"}, {"authorId": "2811490", "name": "D.

The experiments on link detection of named entities using the strategies of direct association, association matrix and scalar association matrix verify that the double-check frequencies are reliable. Further study on named entity clustering shows that the five measures are quite useful. In particular, CODC measure is very stable on word-word and name-name experiments. The application of CODC measure to expand community chains for personal name disambiguation achieves 9.65% and 14.22% increase compared to the system without community expansion.

Our approach also makes it easy to incorporate non-local information from other documents in the test corpus, and this gives us a 13.3% error reduction over NER systems using local-information alone.
