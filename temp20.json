Over 93 per cent of the word tags were correctly selected by using a matrix of tag pair probabilities and this figure was upgraded by a further 3 per cent by retagging problematic strings of words prior to disambiguation and by altering the probability weightings for sequences of three tags. The remaining 3 to 4 per cent were corrected by a human post-editor.The system was originally designed to run in batch mode over the corpus but we have recently modified procedures to run interactively for sample sentences typed in by a user at a terminal. We are currently extending the word tag set and improving the word tagging procedures to further reduce manual intervention.

Two head-finding heuristics are described for locating the genus terms in noun and verb definitions. The assumption is that the genus term represents inherent features of the word it defines. The two heuristics have been used to process definitions of 40,000 nouns and 8,000 verbs, producing indexes in which each genus term is associated with the words it defined. The Sprout program interactively grows a taxonomic \"tree\" from any specified root feature by consulting the genus index. Its output is a tree in which all of the nodes have the root feature for at least one of their senses. The Filter program uses an inverted form of the genus index. Filtering begins with an initial filter file consisting of words that have a given feature (e.g. [+human]) in all of their senses. The program then locates, in the index, words whose genus terms all appear in the filter file. The output is a list of new words that have the given feature in all of their senses.", "venue": "Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics", "year": 1985, "referenceCount": 6, "citationCount": 203, "influentialCitationCount": 3, "isOpenAccess": true, "openAccessPdf": {"url": "http://dl.acm.org/ft_gateway.cfm?id=981247&type=pdf", "status": "BRONZE"}, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "s2FieldsOfStudy": [{"category": "Computer Science", "source": "external"}, {"category": "Computer Science", "source": "s2-fos-model"}], "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle", "Conference"], "publicationDate": "1985-07-08", "journal": {"pages": "299-304"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "2257276998", "name": "M.

The method of constructing these representations is applicable to expressions with center embedding, and results in representations which seem to reflect the ways in which people actually parse those expressions. Both the representations and their interpretations can be computed from the expressions from left to right by finite-state devices.The class of acceptable expressions of a natural language L all manifest no more than a small, fixed, finite degree n of center embedding. From this observation, it follows that the ability of human beings to parse the expressions of L can be modeled by a finite transducer that associates with the acceptable expressions of L representations of the structural descriptions of those expressions. This paper considers some initial steps in the construction of such a model. The first step is to determine a method of representating the class of constituent structures of the expressions of L without center embedding in such a way that the members of that class themselves have no more than a small fixed finite degree of center embedding. Given a grammar that directly generates that class of constituent structures, it is not difficult to construct a deterministic finite-state transducer (parser) that assigns the appropriate members of that class to the noncenter-embedded expressions of L from left to right. The second step is to extend the method so that it is capable of representing the class of constituent structures of expressions of L with no more than degree n of center embedding in a manner which appears to accord with the way in which human beings actually parse those sentences. Given certain reasonable assumptions about the character of the rules of grammar of natural languages, we show how this step can also be taken.", "venue": "Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics", "year": 1984, "referenceCount": 2, "citationCount": 14, "influentialCitationCount": 0, "isOpenAccess": true, "openAccessPdf": {"url": "http://dl.acm.org/ft_gateway.cfm?id=980498&type=pdf", "status": "BRONZE"}, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "s2FieldsOfStudy": [{"category": "Computer Science", "source": "external"}, {"category": "Computer Science", "source": "s2-fos-model"}], "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle", "Conference"], "publicationDate": "1984-07-02", "journal": {"pages": "24-27"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "2347029", "name": "D.

While English still appears to be a CFL as far as I can tell, new arguments (some not yet published) appear to show for the first time that some languages are not CFL's.

It is not, however, sufficient. In particular, if the system has reason to believe that its planned response nfight lead the user to draw an inference that it knows to be false, then it must block it by nmdifying or adding to its response. The problem is that a system neither can nor should explore all eonchtsions a user might possibly draw: its reasoning must be constrained in some systematic and well-motivated way. Such cooperative behavior was investigated in [5], in which a modification of Griee's Maxim of Quality is proposed: Grice's Maxim of QualityDo not say what you believe to be false or for which you lack adequate evidence. Joshi's Revised Maxim of Quality If you, the speaker, plan to say anything which may imply for the hearer something that you believe to be false, then provide further information to block it. This behavior was studied in the context of interpreting certain definite noun phrases. In this paper, we investigate this revised principle as applied to question answering. In particular the goals of the research described here are to: I. characterize tractable cases in which the system as respondent (R) can anticipate the possibility of the user/questioner (Q) drawing false conclusions from its response and can hence alter or expand its response so as to prevent it happening; 2. develop a formal method for computing the projected inferences that Q may draw from a particular response, identifying those 1This work is partially supported by NSF Grants MCS 81-07290, MCS 8.3-05221, and [ST 83-11,100. 2At present visiting the Department of Computer and Information Science, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, PA 19104. factors whose presence or absence catalyzes the inferences; 3. enable the system to generate modifications of its response that can defuse possible false inferences and that [nay provide additional useful information as well. Before we begin, it is important to see how this work differs from our related work on responding when the system notices a discrepancy between its beliefs and those of its user [7, 8, 9, 18]. For example, if a user asks \u2022 How many French students failed CSEI21 last t e rm? ' , he shows that he .believes inter alia that the set of French students is non-empty, that there is a course CSEI21, and that it, was given last term. If the system simply answers \" N o n e ' , he will assume the system concurs w'ith these b~diefs since the answer is consistent with them. Furthermore, he may conclude that French students do r;'d.her well in a difficult course. But this may be a false conclusion if the system doesn' t hold to all of those beliefs (e.g., it doesn' t know of any French students). Thus while the system's assertion \"No French students failed CSEI21 last term\" is true, it has misled the user (1) inlo believing it concurs with the user's beliefs and (2) into drawing additional false conclusions from its response. 3 The differences between this related work and the current enterprise are that: 1. It is no_~t assumed in the current enterprise that there is any overt indication that the domain beliefs of the user are in any way at odds with those of the system. 2. In our related work, the user draws a false conclusion from what is said because the presuppositions of the response are not in accord with the system's beliefs {following a nice analysis in [lO]). In the current enterpri.~e, the us~,r draws a false conclusion from what is said because the system's response behavior is not in accord with the user's expectations.

In par t icular , I will suggest t h a t the task of providing a na tu ra l language interface to a rich p rog ramming env i ronment offers a convenient yet chal lenging extension of work already being done wi th d a t a b a s e query. Fi rs t I recite some of the meri ts of cont inuing research on na tu r a l language wi th in the confines of cons t ruc t ing an interface for ord inary da tabases . One advantage is t ha t the speed of processing is not of overwhelming impor tance in this appl icat ion, since one who requests informat ion from a da t abase can expect the retrieval to take t ime, wi th or w i thou t a na tu ra l language interface. Of course speed is desirable, and wait ing for answers to apparent ly simple requests will be i r r i ta t ing, bu t some delay will be tolerable. This tolerance on the par t of the user will, I suggest, disappea r in appl icat ions where an a t t e m p t is made to engage a sys tem in dialogue wi th the user, as would be the case in some exper t systems, or in teaching systems. Assuming t h a t na t u r a l language systems will not by themselves get faster as they are made to cope with larger f ragments of a na tu ra l language, it will be useful to cont inue with d a t a b a s e query while we wait for miracles of technology to fill our demands for ever greater processing speed. A second reason for not yet abandon ing the da tabase query as a tes t env i ronment is t ha t a great deal of impor t an t na tu r a l language processing research remains to be done in general izing systems to cope with more t han one na tu ra l language. Work on language universals gives reason to believe t h a t some significant pa r t of a na tu ra l language sys tem for English should be recyclable in cons t ruc t ing a sys tem for some o ther language. How much these cross-linguistic concerns ought to affect the cons t ruc t ion of a par t icular sys tem is itself one of the quest ions deserving of a t t ent ion, bu t our experience to date suggests t h a t it pays to avoid language-par t icu lar solutions in an implementa t ion which aspires to t r e a tmen t of any sizable f ragment of a language, even a single language like English. The degree of languageindependence tha t a na tu ra l language sys tem can boas t may also prove to be one useful metric for evaluating and compar ing such systems. [t seems clear t ha t even the task of answering da tabase queries will provide a more t h a n adequa te supply of linguistically interest ing problems for this line of research. Finally, it has s imply not been our exper ience at Hewle t t -Packard t h a t there is any shor tage of theoret ical ly in teres t ing problems to solve in cons t ruc t ing a na tu ra l language interface for da tabases . For example, in bui lding such an interface, we have recent ly designed and implemented a hierarchical ly s t ruc tu red lexicon for a f ragment of English, t oge the r wi th a set of lexical rules t h a t can be run e i ther when loading the system, or when parsing, to great ly exp a n d the size of the lexicon actual ly used in the system. Several quest ions of theore t ica l interest t h a t arose in t h a t process remain unanswered; at least some can be answered by exper imen t ing wi th our present sys tem, funct ioning simply as an interface to an ord inary relat ional da tabase . Having argued t h a t significant work remains to be done in n a t u r a l language processing as an interface to da tabases , I nonethe less believe t ha t it would be fruitful to expand the scope of a na tu ra l language interface, to permi t some man ipu l a t i on of a p rog ramming env i ronment , allowing not only the retr ieval of informat ion describing the s ta te of the sys tem, bu t also some modif icat ion of the sys tem via na t ural language. Of course, such a task would be faci l i tated by having the informat ion abou t the env i ronmen t s tored in a m a n n e r s imilar to t h a t of a da tabase , so t h a t our a t t ent ion could be devoted to the new range of linguistic issues raised, r a t h e r t han to details of how the whole programming env i ronmen t is s t ruc tu red and main ta ined . I will not offer an account of how such a merging of da t abase and general p rog ramming env i ronment might be accomplished, bu t ins tead will offer some mot iva t ion for s t re tch ing na tu ra l language research in this direction. It seems clear, first of all, t h a t such an interface would be useful, given t h a t even a common p rogramming envir onmen t provides a wide array of tools, not all of which are familiar to any one user. While it is usually the case t ha t one who is accus tomed to a given facility would be h a m p e r e d by having to employ only a na tu ra l language interface to accomplish familiar tasks (e.g., imagine typing \"Move down to the beginning of the next line\" every t ime a ca r r i agere tu rn was required) , such an interface would be invaluable when t ry ing to utilize an unfamil iar par t of the system. A re la ted benefit would be the ability of a user new to a p rogramming env i ronment to customize t h a t env i ronmen t w i thou t any detai led knowledge of it.

While retaining structures and operations similar to those of Marcus' PARSIFAL parser [Marcus 80] the grammar language incorporates the following changes. (1) The use of productions operating in parallel has essentially been eliminated and instead the productions are organized into sequences. Not only does this improve the understandability of the grammar, it is felt that this organization corresponds more closely to the task of performing the sequence of buffer transformations and attachments required to parse the most common constituent types. (2) A general method for interfacing between the parser and a semantic representation system is introduced. This interface is independent of the particular semantic representation used and hides all details of the semantic processing from the grammar writer. (3) The interface also provides a general method for dealing with syntactic ambiguities which arise from the attachment of optional modifiers such as prepositional phrases. This frees the grammar writer from determining each point at which such ambiguities can occur.", "venue": "Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics", "year": 1984, "referenceCount": 7, "citationCount": 1, "influentialCitationCount": 0, "isOpenAccess": true, "openAccessPdf": {"url": "http://dl.acm.org/ft_gateway.cfm?id=980543&type=pdf", "status": "BRONZE"}, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "s2FieldsOfStudy": [{"category": "Computer Science", "source": "external"}, {"category": "Computer Science", "source": "s2-fos-model"}], "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle", "Conference"], "publicationDate": "1984-07-02", "journal": {"pages": "239-242"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "2055677000", "name": "Alan W.

For example, birds can fly is a disposition, as are the propositions Swedes are blond and Spaniards are dark.An idea which underlies the theory described in this paper is that a disposition may be viewed as a proposition with implicit fuzzy quantifiers which are approximations to all and always, e.g., almost all, almost always, most, frequently, etc. For example, birds can fly may be interpreted as the result of supressing the fuzzy quantifier most in the proposition most birds can fly. Similarly, young men like young women may be read as most young men like mostly young women. The process of transforming a disposition into a proposition is referred to as explicitation or restoration.Explicitation sets the stage for representing the meaning of a proposition through the use of test-score semantics (Zadeh, 1978, 1982). In this approach to semantics, the meaning of a proposition, p, is represented as a procedure which tests, scores and aggregates the elastic constraints which are induced by p.The paper closes with a description of an approach to reasoning with dispositions which is based on the concept of a fuzzy syllogism. Syllogistic reasoning with dispositions has an important bearing on commonsense reasoning as well as on the management of uncertainty in expert systems. As a simple application of the techniques described in this paper, we formulate a definition of typicality -- a concept which plays an important role in human cognition and is of relevance to default reasoning.", "venue": "Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics", "year": 1984, "referenceCount": 49, "citationCount": 122, "influentialCitationCount": 5, "isOpenAccess": true, "openAccessPdf": {"url": "https://aclanthology.org/P84-1064.pdf", "status": "BRONZE"}, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science", "Mathematics"], "s2FieldsOfStudy": [{"category": "Computer Science", "source": "external"}, {"category": "Mathematics", "source": "external"}, {"category": "Computer Science", "source": "s2-fos-model"}], "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle", "Conference"], "publicationDate": "1984-07-02", "journal": {"pages": "312-318"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "2975527", "name": "L.

The enormous potentialities of the information implicitly stored in a standard printed dictionary or a MRD can only be evidenced and made explicit when the same data are given a new logical structure in a data base model, and exploited by appropriate software. A suitable use of DB methodology is a good starting point to discover several kinds of lexical, morphological, syntactic, and semantic relationships between lexieal entries which would otherwise have remained unexploited. Moreover, the transformation of a \"very large-scale\" MRD into a LDB provides the means of operating throughout the lexicon in a really extensive manner. I think in fact that an \"almost exhaustive\" approach to lexical facts is essential both for reliable investigations of a lexical system, and for many kinds of linguistic applications which cannot be restricted to a particular domain of discourse. The possibility of abstracting significant regularities from recurrent patterns of natural language definitions by means of suitable computational methods, and of reaching a formalization of a number of important structuring relations within the lexicon will be discussed. An overview of the \"associative links\" already produced in the Italian LDB, and of other allowable interconnections will be given. In a \"relational\" organization of a computerized dictionary with complex interlinked structures, each word acquires its meaning as a result of its position in some of the partitionings created by the formalized relations. When an entry is activated, all of its relations with other entries can be activated, too. Conversely, when a relation is activated, all of its linked concepts are made immediately available. Conceptual and linguistic information at many levels is thus interactively retrievable from the LDB following the appropriate pointers. I shall especially take into consideration those types of relations which can be of relevance not only for \"Computational Lexicology\" research, but also in a more general Computational Linguistics framework. An example is provided by derivational relationships which, when formalized, give rise to families of semantically and syntactically connected entries, linked to the same base-word node, and substitutable in different syntactic formulations of the same conceptual meanings.

Ideally, of course, the two enterprises would be conflated, material from a single basic store of lexical information being furnished to different clients in different forms. Such a conflation would, if it could be accomplished, be beneficial to all parties.

If this is correct, the semantic description of a natural language expression should output not only the 'informative content' of that expression, but also all sorts of indications concerning the way this expression may be used or interpreted. In particular, the argumentative power of utterances is due to argumentative indications conveyed by the sentences uttered, indications that are not part of their informative content.

We show that a number of basic studies such as time expansion/compression, pitch modifications and spectral expansion/compression can be made to study the effect of these parameters on the quality of synthetic speech. A systematic study is made to determine factors responsible for unnaturalness in synthetic speech. It is found that the shape of the glottal pulse determines the quality to a large extent.

This is achieved by introducing a mechanism for the hypothesization of syntactic structures, which is largely independent of the rules defining the well-formedness. On the contrary, the second level of syntactic knowledge embodies those rules and is used to validate the hypotheses emitted by the first level. Alternative hypotheses are obtained, when needed, by means of local reorganizations of the parse tree.

Yet it is obvious that people do not entertain all 120 possibilities, and people really do understand the sentence. The problem is not Just that inferencing is required for disamblguation. It is that people never do dlsambiguate completely. A single quantifier scoping is never chosen. (Van Lehn [1978] and Bobrow and Webber [1980] have also made this point.)

We are using a Montague-inspired approach to semantics in an integrated NLU and problem-solving system that we are building. Like Montague's, our semantics are compositional by design and strongly typed, with semantic rules in one-to-one correspondence with the meaning-affecting rules of a Marcus-style parser. We have replaced Montague's semantic objects, functors and truth conditions, with the elements of the frame language Frail, and added a word sense and case slot disambiguation system.

A user of a natural-language-processing system would naturally expect it to reflect the same preferences.

We have developed a parsing algorithm--a variant of the LALR(I) shift-reduce algorithm--that models the preference behavior of native speakers for a range of syntactic preference phenomena reported in the psycholinguistic literature, including the recent data on lexical preferences. The algorithm yields the preferred parse deterministically, without building multiple parse trees and choosing among them. As a side effect, it displays appropriate behavior in processing the much discussed garden-path sentences. The parsing algorithm has been implemented and has confirmed the feasibility of our approach to the modeling of these phenomena.", "venue": "Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics", "year": 1983, "referenceCount": 12, "citationCount": 95, "influentialCitationCount": 6, "isOpenAccess": true, "openAccessPdf": {"url": "http://dl.acm.org/ft_gateway.cfm?id=981334&type=pdf", "status": "BRONZE"}, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "s2FieldsOfStudy": [{"category": "Computer Science", "source": "external"}, {"category": "Computer Science", "source": "s2-fos-model"}, {"category": "Linguistics", "source": "s2-fos-model"}], "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle", "Conference"], "publicationDate": "1983-06-15", "journal": {"pages": "113-118"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "1692491", "name": "S.

The explanation avoids the problems with Marcus' [1980] attempt to account for the same constraint. The argument is robust with respect to machine implementation, and thus avoids the problems that often arise when making detailed claims about parsing efficiency.

Dynamic models are incomplete models that include only the information needed for an application and to which information can be added. Dynamic models are basically approximations of larger conventional models, but differ is several interesting ways.The difference discussed here is the possibility of inconsistent information being included in the model. If a computation causes the model to expand, the result of that computation may be different than the result of performing that same computation with respect to the newly expanded model (i. e. the result is inconsistent with the information currently in the dynamic model). Mechanisms are introduced to eliminate these local (temporary) inconsistencies, but the most natural mechanism can introduce permanent inconsistencies in the information contained in the dynamic model. These inconsistencies are similar to those that people have in their knowledge and beliefs.

Comprehension is viewed as a process dependent on the conceptual specialists (they contain the inferential knowledge), the schemata or frames (they contain the declarative knowledge), and a parser. The function of the parser is to produce a segmentation of the sentences in a case frame structure, thus determininig the meaning of prepositions, polysemous verbs, noun group etc. The function of this parser is not to produce an output to be interpreted by semantic routines or an interpreter, but to start the parsing process and proceed until a concept relevant to the theme of the text is recognized. Then the concept takes control of the comprehension process overriding the lower level linguistic process. Hence comprehension is viewed as a process in which high level sources of knowledge (concepts) override lower level linguistic processes.", "venue": "Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics", "year": 1982, "referenceCount": 21, "citationCount": 9, "influentialCitationCount": 0, "isOpenAccess": true, "openAccessPdf": null, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "s2FieldsOfStudy": [{"category": "Computer Science", "source": "external"}, {"category": "Computer Science", "source": "s2-fos-model"}], "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle", "Conference"], "publicationDate": "1982-06-16", "journal": {"pages": "36-43"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "145535585", "name": "F.

The level of performance achieved by natural language database access systems varies considerably, with the more robust systems operating within a narrow domain (i.e., content area) and relying heavily on domain-specific knowledge to guide the language understanding process. Transporting a system constructed for one domain into a new domain is extremely resource-intensive because a new set of domain-specific knowledge must be encoded.In order to reduce the cost of transportation, a great deal of current research has focussed on building natural language access systems that are domain-independent. More specifically, these systems attempt to use syntactic knowledge in conjunction with knowledge about the structure of the database as a substitute for conceptual knowledge regarding the database content area.

In many cases this correspondence seems sufficient to interpret NL queries. NL update seems to require database counterparts for active verbs, such as \"hire,\" \"schedule\" and \"enroll,\" rather than for stative entities. There seem to be no natural candidates to fill this role.We suggest a database counterpart for active verbs, which we call verbgraphs . The verbgraphs may be used to support NL update.

We argue that theoretical developments in GPSG syntax and in Montague semantics have specific advantages to bring to this domain of computational linguistics. The syntax and semantics of the system are totally domain-independent, and thus, in principle, highly portable.

To this date, this parser is one of the best documented programs and the extensive discussions cover a wide range of English syntax. It is sobering to recall that this analyzer was implemented on an IBM 7090 computer using 32K words of memory with tape as its mass storage medium. A great deal of attention was focussed on means to deal with the main memory and mass storage limitations. It is also interesting to reflect back on the decision made in the Harvard Syntactic Analyzer to use a large number of parts of speech, presumably, to aid the refinement of the analysis. Unfortunately, this introduction of such a large number of parts of speech (approximately 300) led to a large number of unanticipated ambiguous parsings, rather than cutting down on the number of legitimate parsings as had been hoped for. This analyzer functioned at a time when revelations about the amount of inherent ambiguity in English (and other natural languages) was a relatively new thing and the Harvard Analyzer produced all possible parsings for a given sentence. At that time, some effort was focused on discovering a use for all these different parsings and I can recall that one such application was the parsing of the Geneva Nuclear Convention. By displaying the large number of possible interpretations of the sentence, it was in fact possible to flush out possible misinterpretations of the document and I believe that some editing was performed in order to remove these ambiguities.", "venue": "Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics", "year": 1982, "referenceCount": 0, "citationCount": 0, "influentialCitationCount": 0, "isOpenAccess": true, "openAccessPdf": null, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "s2FieldsOfStudy": [{"category": "Computer Science", "source": "external"}, {"category": "Computer Science", "source": "s2-fos-model"}], "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle", "Conference"], "publicationDate": "1982-06-16", "journal": {"pages": "104-106"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "80309663", "name": "Jonathan Allen"}]}, {"paperId": "60a73edfddb85b4ed58a4bf3eb5f51d7e7081742", "externalIds": {"MAG": "2108378026", "ACL": "P82-1026", "DBLP": "conf/acl/Sondheimer82", "DOI": "10.3115/981251.981282", "CorpusId": 30583482}, "corpusId": 30583482, "publicationVenue": {"id": "1e33b3be-b2ab-46e9-96e8-d4eb4bad6e44", "name": "Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics", "type": "conference", "alternate_names": ["Annu Meet Assoc Comput Linguistics", "Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics", "ACL", "Meet Assoc Comput Linguistics"], "url": "https://www.aclweb.org/anthology/venues/acl/"}, "url": "https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/60a73edfddb85b4ed58a4bf3eb5f51d7e7081742", "title": "On the Present", "abstract": "There are certainly many reasons.

A, I. Corporation offers licenses for customers to use the INTELLECT software on their computers, to access their databases. We now have a number of customer installations , plus reports from companies that are marketing INTELLECT under agreements with us, so that we can begin to discuss user reactions as possible criteria for evaluating our system. INTELLECT's basic function is to translate typed English queries into retrieval commands for a database management system, then present the retrieved data, or answers based on it, to the terminal user. It is a general software tool, which can be easily applied to a wide variety of databases and user environments. For each database, a Lexicon, or dictionary, must be prepared. The Lexicon describes the words and phrases relevant to the data and how they relate to the data items. The system maintains a log of all queries, for analysis of its performance. Artificial Intelligence Corporation was founded about five years ago, for the specific purpose of developing and marketing an English language database query product. INTELLECT was the creation of Dr. Larry Harris, who presently supervises its ou-golng development.

Its syntactic component is a transformational grammar parser [1, 2, ~], and its semantic Gomponqnt is a Knuth attribute grammor [~, 5]. The combination of these components providQs sufficiQnt generality, conveniQnga, and efficiency to implement a broad range of linguistic models; in addition to a wide spectrum of transformational grammars, Gilder-type phrase structure grammar [6] and lexigal functional grammar [7] systems appear to be cases in point, for example. The Particular grammar Nhich was, in fact, developed, however, was closest tO those of the genQrative semantics variety of trsnsformationel grammar; both the underlying structures assigned to sQntences and the transformations employed to effect that assignmQnt traced their origins to the generative semantics model. The system ~orks by finding the undQrlying structures corresponding tO English queries through the use of the transformational parsing facility. Those underlying structures are then translated to logical forms in a domain relationol calculus by the Knuth attribute grammar component. Evaluation of logical forms with respect to a given data base completes the question-answering process. Our first logical form evaluator took the form of a toy implementation of a relational data base system in LISP. We soon reelaced the low level tuple retrieval facilities of this implementation with the RSS (Relational StorogQ System) portion of the IBM System R [8], This version of logicol form evoluation was the one employed in the field testing to be dQscribed. In a more recent version of the system, however, it has been replacod by a translation of logical forms, first to equivalent logical forms in a set domain relational calculus and then to appropriate expressions in the 5el language, SystQm RIs high level query language. The first data base to which the system was applied was one concerning business statistics such as the sales, earnings, number of employees, etc. of 60 large companies over a five-year Period. This was a toy data base, to be sure, but it was useful tO US in developing our System. A later dota base contained the basic land identification records of about 10,000 parcels of land in a city nQar our research center.

Because discourse generation is a relatively new branch of Artificial Intelligence, only a few incomplete discourse generators have been developed. A study of those efforts reveals the nature of the task, what makes it difficult, and how the complexities of discourse generation can be controlled. This report compares two recent discourse generation systems: PROTEUS, by Anthony Davey at the University of Edinburgh, and KDS, by Mann and Moore at USC/Information Sciences Institute. Viewing the systems separately, the author identifies particular techniques in each system that contribute strongly to the quality of the resulting text. A comparison of the two systems follows, with a discussion of their common failings and the possibility of creating a new system that combines the strengths of both PROTEUS and KDS. In a text-production system high and special demands are placed on the grammar and the lexicon. This report views these components in such a system. First, the subcomponents dealing with semantic and syntactic information are presented separately. The problems of relating these twomore\u00a0\u00bb types of information are then identified. Finally, strategies designed to meet the problems are proposed and discussed.

However, despite the relevance of pronouns for comprehension and language cheorT, the processes chat contribute to pronoun resolution have proved notoriously difficult Co pin down. Part of the difficulty arises from the wide range of fac=ors that can affect which antecedent noun phrase in a tex~ is usderstood to be co-referentlal with a particular pronoun. These factors can range from simple number/gender agreement through selectional rescrlc~ions co quite complex \"knowledge chat has been acquired from the CaxC (see Webber, (1978) for a neatly illustrated description of many of these factors). Research in psychology, artificial intelligence a~d linguistics has gone a long way toward identifying some of these factors and t h e i r r o l e in p ronoun r e s o l u ~ i o n . F o r instance, in psychology, research carried ouC by Caramazza =-d his colleagues (Caramazza et el, 1977) as well as research chat I have dune (Ehrllch, 1980), has demuns~rated that number/sender agreement really c=fumcciun t o constrain the choice of referent in a way Chat signiflcantly facilltaCes processing. Within an AI framework, there has been some very interesting work carried out by Sidner (1977) m~d Grosz (1977) thac seeks to identify the current topic of a Cex1: and co show Chat knowledge of the topic can considerably sillily pronoun resolutlon. I t is important that people a r e able co select appropriate referents for pronouns and co have some basis for that decision. The research discussed so far has mentioned some of the factors Chac contribute co chose decisiuns. However, part of ~he problem of really u n d e r s t a n d i n g how people resolve pronouns is knowing how Certainly it is important a~d useful to polnc to a particular factor as concributlng to a reference decision, but in many texts more than one of these factors will be available to a reader or listener. One problem for the theorist is then to explaln which factor predominates in the decision as well as to describe the scheduling of evaluaclon procedures. If it could be shown that there was a stricc ordering in which tests were applied, say, number/gender agreement followed by selectionai restrictions followed by inference procedures, pronoun resoluclon may be simpler to explain. At our present level of knowledge it is dlfficulc to discern ordering principles chat have any degree of generality. For Instance, for every example where the topic seems to determine choice, a sinLilar example c~often be found where the more recent antecedent is preferred over the one that forms part of the topic. Moreover, even this claim begs the quesclon of how the coplc can be identified unambiguously. A different approach is possible. The process of assigning a referent Co a pronoun c~m be viewed as utilizing two kinds of strategies. One strategy is concerned with selecting the best referent from amongst the candidates available. The ocher strategy is concerned with searching through memory for the candidates. These two types of strategy, which will be referred to msem\u00a2-lically as inference and search strategies, have different kinds of characteristics. A search strategy dictates the order in which candldaces are evaluated, but has no machinery for carrying out the evaluation. The inference strategy helps to set up the representaclon of the information in the cexC agains c which candldacas can be evaluated, but has ~o way of finding the c~aldidates. ~n the rest of this paper, she way these straCegles ~ighc interact will be explored and the results of two studies will be reported that bear on", "venue": "Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics", "year": 1981, "referenceCount": 16, "citationCount": 7, "influentialCitationCount": 0, "isOpenAccess": true, "openAccessPdf": {"url": "http://dl.acm.org/ft_gateway.cfm?id=981946&type=pdf", "status": "BRONZE"}, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "s2FieldsOfStudy": [{"category": "Computer Science", "source": "external"}, {"category": "Linguistics", "source": "s2-fos-model"}], "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle", "Conference"], "publicationDate": "1981-06-29", "journal": {"pages": "89-93"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "2350399", "name": "Karen Ehrlich"}]}, {"paperId": "56d6dae2aa3d16822c8d544096fb4d5e09943851", "externalIds": {"MAG": "2096163073", "DBLP": "conf/acl/Robinson81", "ACL": "P81-1020", "DOI": "10.3115/981923.981948", "CorpusId": 12025364}, "corpusId": 12025364, "publicationVenue": {"id": "1e33b3be-b2ab-46e9-96e8-d4eb4bad6e44", "name": "Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics", "type": "conference", "alternate_names": ["Annu Meet Assoc Comput Linguistics", "Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics", "ACL", "Meet Assoc Comput Linguistics"], "url": "https://www.aclweb.org/anthology/venues/acl/"}, "url": "https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/56d6dae2aa3d16822c8d544096fb4d5e09943851", "title": "Perspectives on Parsing Issues", "abstract": "Nowhere is t h e tension between the two areas of our field--computatlon and llnguistlcs--more apparent than in the issues that arise in connection with parsing natural language input.

This paper surveys some of the key problems that arise in defining a system of representation for the logical forms of English sentences and suggests possible approaches to their solution. The author first looks at some general issues relating to the notion of logical form, explaining why it makes sense to define such a notion only for sentences in context, not in isolation, and then discusses the relationship between research on logical form and work on knowledge representation in artificial intelligence.

This thesis examines the problems encountered in interpreting natural language updates, and describes an implemented system that performs simple updates. \nThe difficulties associated with natural language updates results from the fact that the user will naturally phrase requests with respect to his conception of the domain, which may be a considerable simplification of the actual underlying database structure. Updates that are meaningful and unambiguous from the user's standpoint may not translate into reasonable changes to the underlying database. \nThe PIQUE system (Program for Interpretation of Queries and Updates in English) operates by maintaining a simple model of the user and interpreting update requests with respect to that model. For a given request, a limited set of \"candidate updates\"--alternative ways of fulfilling the request--are considered, and ranked according to a set of domain-independent heuristics that reflect general properties of \"reasonable\" updates. The leading candidate may be performed, or the highest ranking alternatives presented to the user for selection. The resultant action may also include a warning to the user about unanticipated side effects, or an explanation for the failure to fulfill a request. \nThis thesis describes the PIQUE system in detail, presents examples of its operation, and discusses the effectiveness of the system with respect to coverage, accuracy, efficiency, and portability.

One expects such uses will refer more or less strictly to a closed, explicit, and precise chunk of world knowledge.

It addresses the problem of interpreting and generating \"locative predications\" (expressions made up of two noun-phrases governed by a preposition used spatially). It identifies and describes a number of object characteristics beyond shape (section 1) and contextual factors (section 2) which bear on these processes. Drawing on these descriptions, the third section proposes core meanings for two categories of prepositions, and describes some of the transformations these core meanings are subject to in context.

A speaker must also run similar event simulations on his own descriptions in order to be able to judge when the hearer has been given sufficient information to construct an appropriate \"picture\", and to be able to respond appropriately to the hearer's questions about or responses to the scene description.In this paper I explore some simple scene description examples in which a hearer must make judgements involving reasoning about scenes, space, common-sense physics, cause-effect relationships, etc. While I propose some mechanisms for dealing with such scene descriptions, my primary concern at this time is to flesh out our understanding of just what the mechanisms must accomplish: what information will be available to them and what information must be found or generated to account for the inferences we know are actually made.", "venue": "Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics", "year": 1980, "referenceCount": 26, "citationCount": 15, "influentialCitationCount": 0, "isOpenAccess": true, "openAccessPdf": {"url": "http://dl.acm.org/ft_gateway.cfm?id=981439&type=pdf", "status": "BRONZE"}, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "s2FieldsOfStudy": [{"category": "Computer Science", "source": "external"}, {"category": "Philosophy", "source": "s2-fos-model"}], "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle", "Conference"], "publicationDate": "1980-06-19", "journal": {"name": "", "pages": "7-11", "volume": ""}, "authors": [{"authorId": "1788375", "name": "D.

(Chafe, 1974; Goguen, Linde, and Weiner, to appear; Grosz, 1977; Halliday and Hasan, 1976; Labov, 1972; Linde, 1974, 1979, 1980a,198Cb; Linde and Goguen, 1978; Linde and Labov, 1975; Folanyi, 1978; Weiner, 1979.) Each such study raises a question about whether the structure discovered is a property of the organization of Language or whether it is entirely a property of the semantic domain. That is, are we discovering general facts about the structure of language at a level beyond the sentence, or are we discovering particular facts about apartment layouts, water pump repair, Watergate politics, etc? Such a crude question does not arise with regard to sentences. Although much of the last twenty years of research in sentential syntax and semantics has been devoted to the investigation of the degree to which syntactic structure can be described independently of semantics, to our knowledge, no one has attempted to argue that all observable regularities of sentential structure are attributable to the structure of the real world plus general cognitive abilities. Yet this claim is often made about regularities of linguistic structure at the discourse level. In order =o demonstrate that at leas= some of the structure found at the discourse level is independent of the structure of the semantic domain, we may show that there are discourse regularities across semantic domains. As primary data, we will use apartment layout description, small group planning, and explanation. These have all been found to be discourse units, that is, bounded linguistic units one level higher than the sentential level, and have all been described within the same formal theory. It should be noted that we do not claim that the structures found in these discourse units is entirely independent of structure of the semantic domain, because of course the structure of the domain has some effect.", "venue": "Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics", "year": 1980, "referenceCount": 13, "citationCount": 5, "influentialCitationCount": 0, "isOpenAccess": true, "openAccessPdf": {"url": "http://dl.acm.org/ft_gateway.cfm?id=981448&type=pdf", "status": "BRONZE"}, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "s2FieldsOfStudy": [{"category": "Computer Science", "source": "external"}, {"category": "Linguistics", "source": "s2-fos-model"}], "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle", "Conference"], "publicationDate": "1980-06-19", "journal": {"name": "", "pages": "35-37", "volume": ""}, "authors": [{"authorId": "39128087", "name": "C.

The necessity of writing programs that demonstrate the validity or invalidity of conceptualizations and assumptions has caused computer scientists to cover a lot of theoretical ground in a very short time, or at least to arrive at a problem area, and to see the problem fairly clearly, that is very contemporary in social theory. There is in fact a discrepancy between the level of sophistication exhibited in locating the problem area (forced by the specific constraints of programming work) and in the theorizations concocted to solve the problem. Thus we find computer scientists and students of language use from several disciplines converging in their interest in the mechanics and metaphysics of social interaction and specifically its linguistic realization. Attempts to write natural language programs delivered the realization that even so basic a feature as nominal reference is no simple thing. In order to give an \"understander\" the wherewithal ~o answer simple questions about a text, one had to provide it with an organized world in which assumptions are inferred, in which exchanges are treated as part of a coherent and minim-fly redundant text, in which things allow for certain actions and relations and not others, and for which it is unclear how to store the information about the world in such a way that it is accessible for all its possible purposes and delivered up in an appropriate way.

Traditionally it has been argued that processing natural language syntax requires very powerful machinery. Many engineers have come to this rather grim conclusion; almost all working parsers are actually Turing Machines (TM). For example, Woods believed that a parser should have TM complexity and specifically designed his Augmented Transition Networks (ATNs) to be Turing Equivalent.(1) \"It is well known (cf. [Chomsky64]) that the strict context-free grammar model is not an adequate mechanism for characterizing the subtleties of natural languages.\" [Woods70]If the problem is really as hard as it appears, then the only solution is to grin and bear it. Our own position is that parsing acceptable sentences is simpler because there are constraints on human performance that drastically reduce the computational complexity. Although Woods correctly observes that competence models are very complex, this observation may not apply directly to a performance problem such as parsing.The claim is that performance limitations actually reduce parsing complexity.

It is therefore natural chac people would expect their com-,nications with machines Co likewise use Chess two modes. To a considerable extent, speech is probably the most natural of the natural-language modes. ~ence, a fascination exists with machines thac respond to spoken commands with synthetic speech responses to create a natural-language interactive discourse. However, although vast amounts of research and development effort have been expended in the search for systems that understand human speech and respond with synthetic speech, the goal of the perfect system remains a~ elusive as ever. Syste ms for producing natural-sounding speech for large vocabularies with unrestricted gr-w.-tical structures and for recognizing spoken speech for large vocabularies with unlimited gr-~-Cical structures and any humber of talkers are still beyond the scats of linguistics and computer science and technology. Given the problems in the speech domain, ic is not surprising Chat most interactions between people and machines are in the visual mode frequently using alphanumeric keyboards as input and textual display as output. Such visual terminals are already in fairly widespread use in industry and are used for a variety of applications including computer progr-n~ing, text editing, and database access. The telephone allows speech celecoa~nications over distance between people. Future visual terminals for the home and businesses will allow textual celecom-,nicacions between people. These visual terminals could also be used co telecommunicate with machines in a way Chat is presently difficult using the telephone and speech.

The few substantial efforts, such as those spearheaded by Olney [2,3], MelOCuk [4], Smith [5], and Simmons [6,7], made some progress, but never came to fruition. Today, lexicography and its products, the dictionaries, remain an untapped resource of uncertain value. Indeed, many who have analyzed the contents of a dictionary have concluded that it is of little value to linguistics or artificial intelligence. Because of the size and complexity of a dictionary, perhaps such a conclusion is inevitable, but I believe it is wrong. To avoid becoming irretrievably lost in the minutiae of a dictionary and to view the real potential of this resource, it is necessary to develop a comprehensive model within which a dictionaryOs detail can be tied together. When this is done, I believe one can identify the requirements for a semantic representation of an entry in the lexicon to be used in natural language processing systems.

An example is given of a combined parsing-generating grammar that parses surface sentences, builds and queries a semantic network knowledge representation, and generates surface sentences in response.", "venue": "Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics", "year": 1979, "referenceCount": 14, "citationCount": 102, "influentialCitationCount": 3, "isOpenAccess": true, "openAccessPdf": null, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "s2FieldsOfStudy": [{"category": "Computer Science", "source": "external"}, {"category": "Computer Science", "source": "s2-fos-model"}], "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle", "Conference"], "publicationDate": "1979-06-29", "journal": {"name": "Computational Linguistics", "pages": "12-25", "volume": "8"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "143739156", "name": "S.

Objects which are close to ones which stand ia a particular relation to the respondent (i.e. physically close, emotionally dear, or belonging to the subject) are not placed in a room but receive horizontal answers instead. For example, all the Israelis answered that Lebanon was \"north of Israel\", and not that it was \"in the MidEast\". Similarly, all the Americans (and half of the Israells) placed Canada in relation to the U.S. Unlike the prominence effect, the salience effect does affect the answer generation algorithm itself, and it bears on individual or cultural differences, not on general semantic com-lderatlons. 4 Specifically, items which ere special to the speaker are tagged in the representation as marked, and this triggers a shift from the vertical to the horizontal algorlthm. All questions considered so far involved one configuration: the two conversants and the target were physically distinct, and together they could he contained in one COmmOn room. This, however, is not the only possible con\u00a3iguratlon. Other confi&~aratious, are possible as well: (a) The conversants and the target may coincide in place, as in the question '~here are we now?\". (b) The conversants ~ay be contained in the target, as in the question \"Where is Israel?\" when Posed in Jerusalem. (c) The conversants may be in different places, as in phone conversations. Strictly speaklng, the Room Algorithm does not apply to these configuratlons. Thus, in (b) the least common room is one level above that of the target, but on what level would the answer be? The Room Algorithm would either return the respondent to the place queried or else require detailed and perhaps cumbersomDclassificatlons, neither option is taken. All the answers to the questions noted were given on the room immediately above the target. In (a) a least common room may not be circumscribed in the manner outlined by the Room Algorithm, whereas in (c) a distinction between the speaker and the hearer has to be introduced. All these cases suggest that the different confi~Jrations do invoke different generation algorithms. Hence, an appraisal of the conFlguration is necessary prior to the application of the answer-generation algorithm proper. So far, the discussion was topological, considering only the spatial configuration holding between the conversants and the object questioned. The respondent 's knowledge of the world was not taken into account. In order to prove the p s y c h o l o g i c a l v a l i d i t y o f an answer g e n e r a t i o n algorithm it is crucial to demonstrate that the answer given is chosen from a class of several feasible answers, and is not the only one possible due to a limited data base. This was the purpose of the closed questionnaires. Two such questionnaires were administered: first, subJests were asked to choose the best of several answers given to them; then they were asked to mark all the answers they deemed true. Three points were of interest. First, the answers given in the first two conditions were not necessarily the most specified ones marked in the third. Second, there were answers in the multiple option condition which were evidently true and commonly known but which were nonetheless not marked by subjects. These answers included reversed prominence (i.e. the relation of a prominent object to a less prominent one), featural answers and ones which were too high on the place hierarchy. Third, an \"~ don't know\" answer on the open questionns/re did not necessarily imply a noanswer in the other conditions. In other words, this answer does not signify complete ignorance, but rather an appreciation on the part of the subject that he cannot f~u 'nish t h e answer he deemm a p p r o p r i a t e . T o g e t h e r , t h e t h r e e p o i n t s i n d i c a t e t h a t t h e r e i s indeed a p s y c h o l o g i c a l p r o c e s s o f a n s w e r g e n e r a t i o n which does no t amount to the specification Of the most detailed information one has regarding the object in question. Still another aspect which has to be considered is the speaker's intention when he poses a question. A study ~ this aspect is just on its way now and at this point, I have to limit myself only to a methodological discussion. Evidently, the process of question-answering requires an appraisal of intention (of. Lehnert, !978), one which involves the evaluation of various contertual, personal and sociological factors. In order to make research feasible, as well as constructive, a factorizatlon of the domain of question-answering, I believe, is needed. In this regard the topological, knowledge and intention aspects were noted. The original Room Theory is an attempt to define the topological aspect. The present study shows that even for this 8spect this Theory is not sufficient. The present discussion suggests that an extended topological theory should consist of the following components : I.

The approach taken leans heavily on theoretical advances in several disciplines, including linguistics, computational linguistics, artificial intelligence, and cognitive psychology. The aim is to model the cognitive activities of the human analyst as he reads and understands message text, distilling its contents into information items of interest to him, and building a conceptual model of the information conveyed by the message. This methodology, although developed on the basis of a restricted subject domain, is presumed to be general, and extensible to other domains.Our approach is centered around the notion of \"event\", and utilizes two major knowledge sources: (1) a model of the sublanguage for event reporting which characterizes the message traffic, and (2), a model of the analyst-user's conceptualization of the world (i.e., a model of the entities and relations characteristic of his world).", "venue": "Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics", "year": 1979, "referenceCount": 0, "citationCount": 5, "influentialCitationCount": 0, "isOpenAccess": true, "openAccessPdf": {"url": "http://dl.acm.org/ft_gateway.cfm?id=982191&type=pdf", "status": "BRONZE"}, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "s2FieldsOfStudy": [{"category": "Computer Science", "source": "external"}, {"category": "Computer Science", "source": "s2-fos-model"}], "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle", "Conference"], "publicationDate": "1979-06-29", "journal": {"name": "", "pages": "95-97", "volume": ""}, "authors": [{"authorId": "144327295", "name": "G.

The goal was that the student should gain a deeper understanding of language itself and that he/she should learn general and transferable problem solving skills.", "venue": "Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics", "year": 1979, "referenceCount": 7, "citationCount": 3, "influentialCitationCount": 0, "isOpenAccess": true, "openAccessPdf": {"url": "http://dl.acm.org/ft_gateway.cfm?id=982195&type=pdf", "status": "BRONZE"}, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "s2FieldsOfStudy": [{"category": "Computer Science", "source": "external"}, {"category": "Education", "source": "s2-fos-model"}], "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle", "Conference"], "publicationDate": "1979-06-29", "journal": {"name": "", "volume": ""}, "authors": [{"authorId": "144902560", "name": "G.
